        Hi! Nice to meet you. My name is Juana Pandey. I am 13 years old as the year of 2021 if you were wondering. You'll find me in Kathmandu city along with my dad and sister. My mom is in the U.S. They are businessman. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.

        I am a student who studies in grade 8 in Ace School.  I feel happy to be a part of this great school with the good friends, helpful and loving teacher and sound school administration. I have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.
        <br>

        I am fond of animals especially dogs. I adore them. I pass my time reading, writing, and dancing. I also like to bake and cook. Recently I have gotten into coding. I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.

        As every man, I have my weeknesses too, I am an introvert when meeting or talking to a person for the first time. I need the habit of meeting a person many times to be able to communicate properly with them. Along with that I also am quite lazy at time but I try to overcome my weeknesses 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the future I aspire to be a model. Posing in front of a  camera has come to me naturally. With being a model I also want to complete my PHD, learn many skills and enjoy life. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My main aim life is trying to be kind to every soul and helping them. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”  These are some of the reasons I want to achieve the crown of Miss World.
        <br>
        <br>
        These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences.
